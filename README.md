This is my first project on TOP. I will update this as I progress through the project.

After finishing the HTML portion of this project, these are the skills I utilized:

- I incorporated a main index file with links to other pages
- I downloaded and moved image files using the command line interface
- I used both types of lists on my pages
- I practiced commenting in my code
- I saved, staged, and committed changes often
- I followed the seven rules of writing a commit message
